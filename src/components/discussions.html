<p>We looked at  the problem of human-machine interface with a question: Can we start interacting with a machine, even if the machine does not know what we mean by our action? The answer is yes, and it is feasible if we know enough about the context of the interaction. The way we solved this is half-way between unsupervised leanrign and supervised learning. We received unlabelled data but because of constraints that aplly to the process geenrating those data (the human in the intercation), we are able to generate a set of hypothetic labels that could be associated to the data. Adn we pick the hytpthesis whose labels makes the more sense wrt. the strucutre of the data. This is more powerful than purely unsupervised learnign as the set of hypheotehis</p>

<p>Interresting contribution to this work would be: first a brainstrom about possible application of this work to positively contribute to society. The fundation are here, many technical development can be imagined and are feasible, but lacking is an application to drive those developments in a useful direction. A proposal of mathematical represenation and treatement of this problem, that ideally emcompass the planning aspects. A new question that emerges from this work and that which is not trivial to address.</p>
