<h2>Analysis of the PIN-entering interface</h2>

<p>Successfully entering a PIN using <a href="#interaction-1">Interaction 1</a> indicates that you understand the principle of interaction between you and our interface. If you have a background in computer science, you probably even know how to implement this at home. But, before moving on with the self-calibrated version of this interface, it is important that we breakdown and name the various elements at play.</p>

<p>First, we should name three components driving the user behavior:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The user's <b>intent</b> is what the user wants the machine to do. Here entering a specific PIN, one digit at a time.</li>
  <li>The user's <b>meaning</b> is what the user wants to say to the machine. Here it is either: "My digit is yellow" or "My digit is grey".</li>
  <li>The user's <b>action</b> is what the user does in order to express their meaning. In <a href="#interaction-1">Interaction 1</a>, user's actions are to press either the left or the right button.</li>
</ul>

<p>In short, an action conveys a meaning that is used to infer an intent. But inferring an intent from a meaning requires a bit of context. With our interface, the context is a user wanting to type a PIN via our interface. In other words, we assume that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The user aims to type a PIN one digit at a time. Thus their current intent is to type one of the ten possible digits.</li>
  <li>The user follows a specific convention of interaction. They indicate the color of the digit they want to type. Thus, the possible meanings are yellow or grey.</li>
  <li>The user can perform one of two actions, pressing either the left or the right button. This is constrained by the design of our interface.</li>
  <li>The <b>mapping between the user's actions and their meanings</b> is known. Pressing the left button conveys the meaning yellow and the right button conveys the meaning grey.</li>
</ul>

<p>The latter is the most important element of our story, it explicits that there is a pre-existing shared understanding between the user and the machine on the meaning conveyed by the pressing of each button. This information is made salient by the colors displayed on each button, the left button is yellow and the right one is grey.</p>

<p>The machine can thus follow this simple reasoning: "If the user presses the yellow button, then we can discard all the grey digits". To be precise, we should better say: "If the user presses the left button (action), then they mean that their digit is currently yellow (meaning), thus their digit is among the yellow ones and we can discard all the grey digits (intent)."</p>

<p>You can visualize this process on the explanatory interface below that displays a side panel showing the inner working of the machine.</p>

<p>You should now have a clear understanding of how our PIN-entering interface works and have acquired some element of language such as action, meaning, intent, context, and action-to-meaning mapping.</p>

<p>In the next section, we introduce the self-calibrating version of this interface in which buttons have no pre-defined colors. You will get to decide the colors of each buttons in your mind and never explicitly tell the machine about it. The machine will nonetheless be able to identify your PIN and the colors of the buttons.</p>
